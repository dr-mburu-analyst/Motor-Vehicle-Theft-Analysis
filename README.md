#### Tools used: Excel, SQL, Power BI

## Project Objective Summary

- **Objective**: As a newly hired data analyst for the police department, your task is to analyze the "Motor Vehicle Theft" dataset and create insightful and user-friendly dashboards and reports.
- These visualizations should help in understanding and presenting key aspects of vehicle theft data.

  ### Project Steps
  - Downloaded the “Motor Vehicle Theft” zip file and extracted the contents to access the dataset files.
  - Opened the dataset files to understand the structure and contents.Identified key tables and columns relevant to the analysis (i.e., stolen vehicles, locations, make details).
  - Used Excel for preliminary data cleaning and transformation including removing duplicates, correcting errors, and formatting data.
  - Performed initial SQL queries to aggregate and manipulate data before importing it into Power BI.
  - Open Power BI Desktop.Connected it to my data source and import the dataset files. Loaded the data into Power BI for further transformation and visualization.
  - Used Power Query Editor to further clean and transform the data. This includes tasks such as filtering out irrelevant data, and creating calculated columns.
  - Prepared the dataset for analysis by setting up relationships between tables and ensuring data integrity.
  - Designed and built dashboards and reports in Power BI based on the transformed data.
  - Focused on creating visualizations that provide clear insights and are easy to understand for stakeholders.
  - Run additional SQL queries to extract specific insights and perform more complex data analysis.
  - Incorporated these insights into my Power BI dashboards and reports.

### Insights from the data analysis
- The analysis of the "Motor Vehicle Theft" dataset reveals critical insights into vehicle theft incidents.
- The data analyzed from the three databases {Locations, Make_details, and Stolen_Vehicles}  provides a comprehensive view of theft occurrences.
#### Key Insights
- The dataset indicates that a total of 4,553 vehicles were reported stolen.
- The average age of the vehicles stolen is 23 years.
- The dataset reveals a sharp increase in vehicle thefts after March 2022.
- The data indicates that over 95% of stolen vehicles are classified as standard vehicles.
- The Oakland region has the highest number of vehicle theft incidents compared to other regions.
- The Oakland region also has a large population, and the data shows that theft incidences are higher in more densely populated regions.
- The station wagon vehicle type is the most frequently targeted for theft.
- Monday experiences the highest number of vehicle theft incidents compared to other days of the week.

#### Recommendations
- Improve security features and educate owners of standard vehicles about theft prevention.
- Address Post-March 2022 Spike by Investigating the cause of the increase and boost surveillance in affected areas.
- Increase law enforcement and community programs in Oakland, which has the highest theft rates.
- Implement specific security measures and awareness campaigns for station wagons, the most stolen vehicle type.
- Enhance monitoring and advise vehicle owners to take extra precautions on Mondays.
- Allocate resources and develop strategies for high-density areas where thefts are more common.
